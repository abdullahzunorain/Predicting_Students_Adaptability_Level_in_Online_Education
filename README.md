### Project: Predicting Students' Adaptability Level in Online Education

#### Overview
This project aims to predict the adaptability level of students in an online education environment using machine learning techniques. The adaptability level indicates how well students can adjust to online learning, which has become increasingly important in the wake of the global shift to remote education.

#### Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

1. **`students_adaptability_level_online_education.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models. It contains various features related to students' demographics, academic background, and other relevant attributes.
2. **`Comparative_Study_of_KNN_and_Decision_tree_for_Predicting_Students_Adaptability_Level_in_Online_Education.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that includes the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of two machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree. It also contains a comparative analysis of the performance of these models.
3. **`Data_report.html`**: An HTML report generated from the Jupyter Notebook, summarizing the findings, including visualizations and performance metrics of the models.
4. **`Distribution.png`**: An image file showing the distribution of adaptability levels among students in the dataset.
5. **`README.md`**: This file provides a detailed description of the project, including the motivation, methodology, results, and instructions for running the code.

#### Motivation
The rapid transition to online education has highlighted the need to understand and predict how students adapt to such environments. Predicting adaptability can help educators and institutions provide better support to students, ensuring a more effective and inclusive learning experience.

#### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset contains features such as age, gender, education level, and various indicators of online learning engagement and performance.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand distributions, relationships, and potential correlations between features and the target variable (adaptability level).
4. **Model Implementation**:
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that predicts the adaptability level based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors in the feature space.
    - **Decision Tree**: A model that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions based on feature values, providing a clear visualization of the decision-making process.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of KNN and Decision Tree using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure robustness.

#### Results
The project includes a comparative analysis of KNN and Decision Tree models. The performance metrics and visualizations help identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model in predicting students' adaptability levels.
